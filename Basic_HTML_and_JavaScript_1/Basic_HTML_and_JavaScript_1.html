In order to permanently change the web page, you’ll need to change the actual files that will be given to the browser.</font></p>
	
<p><b><font color="green">	There is a lot </b>more to know about the DOM, <b><i>and as you do more </i>web development, you’ll pick up a lot <u>more knowledge and skill. But you now have the basic principles </u>and application of the DOM.
